Silky-smooth synths will captivate you and take you to a time long ago… but not forgotten. Like a mother’s cooking, this will instantly transport you back in time to when life was simpler—when all you wanted to do was cruise the winding coastline roads, ever-washed in moonlight, while some hard-hitting basslines and uplifting melodies punch through the night air, interrupted only by the fierce roar of the V8-engine that pulls you endlessly, onwards, into the future.
