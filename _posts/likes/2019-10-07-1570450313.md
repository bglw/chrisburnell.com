  title: "As I’m starting my personal wiki / knowledge base, first thing I’m noticing is that I feel like I shouldn’t just be trying to collect ‘knowledge’ on ‘topics’… if it becomes just a set of ‘facts’ that I’ve discovered about my particular interests, then it’s just a poorly maintained subset of Wikipedia… I think the trick is to make sure not to lose the personal and the personality. It should be the stuff that Wikipedia deliberately avoids."
