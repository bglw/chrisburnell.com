Neil, this is both remarkably well-written and informative! I have to agree with all the points you’ve raised, particularly about the high barrier to entry for non-technical folks wanting to get on the Fediverse, but I think with posts like yours to help educate and on-board those people, we’re making some great strides. I’m anxiously awaiting Part 2!
