0. Add {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="warm water" %}, {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="active dry yeast" text="yeast" %} and ½ tsp of the {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="granulated sugar, divided" text="sugar" %} to the bowl of a stand mixer and stir gently. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. The {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="active dry yeast" text="yeast" %} should "proof" during this time, meaning the water mixture will get slightly foamy looking, which confirms the yeast is working. If this doesn't happen, your {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="active dry yeast" text="yeast" %} is not fresh, or the water was too hot.
0. Add remaining {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="active dry yeast" text="yeast" %} (½ Tbsp + 1 tsp), ¾ cups {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="plain flour" text="flour" %}, ¾ tsp {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="salt" %} and {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="oil (olive, vegetable, canola)" text="oil" %} and mix on medium speed, to combine.
0. Add another ¾ cups {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="plain flour" text="flour" %} and knead mixture for 5–7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl but still be slightly sticky to the touch.
0. Transfer dough to a large, greased bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow to rest in a warm place until double in size (about 1–1½ hours).
0. Once risen, punch dough down and divide it into 6 equal parts. Roll each piece of dough into a 9 inch rope and transfer to a greased cookie sheet dusted with {% include content/ingredient.liquid id="corn flour (optional)" text="corn flour" %}. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise again for 1 hour.
0. {% include content/preheat.liquid text="Bake breadsticks at 220°C/425°F for 10–12 minutes." %}
0. While the breadsticks bake, mix the garlic butter topping ingredients together. Brush butter mixture over the tops of the breadsticks halfway through cooking and again once hot and cooked.
0. Serve warm. Store in a airtight container or in the freezer.
