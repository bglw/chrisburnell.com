This Pen demonstrates the differences between scaling an image with a transform and scaling an image by modifying the dimensions.

Designating the `image-rendering` property as `pixelated` with a **transform** scale seems to result in anti-aliasing around the edges of the image. Applying the same property value to a **dimensional** scale does not seem to exhibit the same anti-aliasing.
