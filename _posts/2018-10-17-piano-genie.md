title: Piano Genie
lede: “Piano Genie, an intelligent controller that maps 8-button input to a full 88-key piano in real time, is in some ways reminiscent of video games such as Rock Band and Guitar Hero that are accessible to novice musicians, with the crucial difference that users can freely improvise on Piano Genie rather than re-enacting songs from a fixed repertoire.”
