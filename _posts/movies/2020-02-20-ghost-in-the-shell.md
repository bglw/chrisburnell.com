This is unquestionably in my top five movies of all time—possibly my favourite—one which I've seen dozens and dozens of times and continues to enchant me every time I watch. The concepts and ideas conveyed by this masterpiece hold me in rapture and permeate my thoughts often. It continues to remain relevant today, even moreso, I would say, as we approach cybernetics as a reality. I cannot recommend *Ghost in the Shell* highly enough.
