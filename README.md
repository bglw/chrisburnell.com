### Description

My website doubles as a blog and as a playground for me to perfect the code that
comprises the site and to experiment with new methodologies and technologies.
You may find that things change quite drastically or strangely over time; this
is because I am always trying to learn new things and encorporate them into my
site or this Github repository. If you have any questions or suggestions, please
don‚Äôt hesitate to get in touch‚Äîvia
[twitter](https://twitter.com/iamchrisburnell) or email‚Äîor open a new issue to
report bugs or suggestions.

While the source for my website is open source, it is not intended to be used as a template for your own website. By all means, copy and share what you like, but make sure it‚Äôs part of something you can call your own. :)
