I use a handful of services to keep track of how people interact with the content I produce. If you have responded to, liked, reposted, quoted, commented on my activity on Twitter, on Mastodon, or this website, it may be stored and displayed on my website. If you would like your interaction(s) removed, blocked, or even corrected, please [get in touch](/contact), and I would be happy to oblige your request.


{% include_cached content/heading.liquid title='Browse Freely' %}

I no longer serve **any** analytics or tracking of any kind. This is because I value privacy on the web, to smoothen the performance out and take fuller control of my website, and to promote [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org){:rel="external"} technologies.

I do, however, employ the use of Service Workers. If you’re using a relatively modern browser, you’ll be able to enjoy the benefits of this technology. In short, it’s a form of client-side caching. This means that your device will cache certain parts of this website in order to provide you a faster experience, and even enable you to take my website offline! I do not (and cannot) collect any information about you or your browsing experience from Service Workers.

If you have any further questions or concerns regarding your privacy on this website, please [contact me](/contact) so that I can address it as soon as possible.
