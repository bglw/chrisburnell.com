{% include_cached content/heading.liquid title='Freelance' %}

I have been doing freelance work, off and on, since about <time datetime="2008">2008</time>, ranging from web design to web development to full website solutions (albeit small). This ramped up slightly as I pursued web development as less of a hobby after high-school and more as a career. While I learned a lot early on, I was never really challenged by the projects, nor was I in a position where I was out of my depth (yet)—and that position is one where I learn and grow my skills most effectively.


{% include_cached content/heading.liquid title='London' %}

In <time datetime="2011-12">December of 2011</time>, I made the decision to move to London to be with my girlfriend, Rachel, who moved from Singapore to work on her Fine Arts degree from *Camberwell* (which she received in <time datetime="2014-06">June 2014</time>)!

After a bit of searching, I found a job at a small startup company that did cab bookings in the city called *Cabfix*. Previously, the codebase that *Cabfix* ran on had been built by a foreign company, and my job, in essence, was to flesh out and refine the branding of the website. This entailed modifying and creating short snippets/modules to be used across various pages of the website. This was (triumphantly) my first job in the field, but my role at *Cabfix* wasn’t thoroughly defined and, again, I wasn’t particularly challenged by the work, so I started to look elsewhere for a deeper role to satiate my desire for a challenge.

*Unfortunately, <time datetimte="2014">sometime in early 2014</time>, Cabfix’s website seems to have gone offline, so I can only assume the company’s goals didn’t pan out as hoped.*

In <time datetime="2012-04">April of 2012</time>, I joined the *Production Team* at *[Squiz](http://squiz.net){:rel="external"}* as a *Front-end Web Developer*. My job involved two general tasks: implementing a website’s functionality into *Squiz’s* CMS, *[Squiz Matrix](https://www.squiz.net/technology/cms){:rel="external"}*, and creating <abbr title="the product of translating a website’s design (usually in PSD format) into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media">cut-ups</abbr>. These tasks were almost always performed as client services and it was in this <q>deliver the best possible projects with fresh technology</q> environment that my passion and thirst for web development skyrocketed. Feeling particularly inclined towards the HTML and CSS side of things, I was often tasked with performing the cut-ups while other team members built the implementation side of things.

Further on down the road, after tackling many amazing projects with the team, with clients like *William Hill*, *The Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation*, and *Middlesex University*, I changed role to become a *User Interface Developer*. No longer sitting in the *Production Team*, but in the *UX team* at *Squiz* is where my focus became solely on building cut-ups and becoming a bridge between Design and Development, as well as aiding in UX projects.

For a long time I was also the organiser of a weekly meeting, *Implementor Scrum*, when the developers in the *Production Team* and other interested colleagues would come together to join heads and discuss future technologies, best practices, and to share fascinating technology on the web. While it was always a fun, team-building event, it also helped to promote web standards and forward-thinking in our work, and opened our eyes to new ideas and smarter solutions to our challenges.

From <time datetime="2014-06">June 2014</time>–<time datetime="2018-02">February 2018</time>, I took on the role of *Web Developer* at *[City, University of London](http://www.city.ac.uk){:rel="external"}*, where I looked forward to carrying the torch forward, and devoting my time and efforts towards perfecting and streamlining the codebase, promoting the ideologies and thirst for strong, readable code I harboured within myself at *Squiz*.

Over the near four years with *City*, I had the opportunity to learn a great deal about the cogs that keep Higher Education ticking. I was able to span a variety of interesting projects and challenges over the years: some small day-to-day tasks and others behemoth undertakings which held key positions in grand University endeavours. Some of the work which I'm particularly proud of includes a News redevelopment, Library event and openings management tools, a Clearing Progressive Web Application, and the development of a from-scratch codebase for the entire Cass Business School. More so than the URLs I affected at *City*, it brought me even more joy to hear the words of my coworkers as I left—that I had taught them a great deal about web development while we worked together, and that together we helped contribute to making education a more accessible and engaging experience for people.

In <time datetime="2018-02">February 2018</time>, after having made a difficult, deliberating choice, I made the choice to work again at *Squiz* as a *Front-End Developer*. I’m extremely excited to see how old traditions have carried forward, how they’ve adapted to new technologies over the last four years, join a new team to push these technologies and rapidly deliver high quality implementations, and to get to work with some of my favourite developers again.


{% include_cached content/heading.liquid title='The Web is Awesome' %}

If you talk someone who knows me well, they will tell you I’m absolutely obsessed with the web, and it’s <del>almost</del> unhealthy. It’s <del>almost</del> sad how excited I can get about semantic code, web standards and best practices, code architecture and organistion, sharing ideas, open source and collaboration, clean and accessible user interfaces, typography, user experience, *[IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/principles){:rel="external"}*, oh, and *CSS*.

I also play the piano, bake bread from time to time, and DM Dungeons & Dragons here and there.
