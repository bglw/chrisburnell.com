Makes two pies.

Combine all ingredients in a heavy pot. Add all ingredients except for the pie crusts and fill pot with water so that it just covers ingredients. Simmer for 1 hour, stirring often.

{~ include content/preheat.liquid text="Begin heating the oven to *175°C/350°F*." %} Let ingredients cool then cover the bottom of two pie plates with dough. Add the cooked ingredients and cover with other two rounds of dough. Make a few incisions into the top of each pie crust to allow steam to escape.

Bake until the tops of the pies are golden brown.
