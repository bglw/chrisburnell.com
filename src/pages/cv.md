## Biography

I’m a self-taught developer driven by a passion for the front-end to create a faster and more open web for everyone. It’s always been important to me to keep abreast of trends on the web, and I enjoy [experimenting](https://codepen.io/chrisburnell) with these technologies to discover use-cases for my work, and I use my website as a platform to guide my learning and share what I’ve learned. In recent years, I’ve also become interested in content ownership online and have gravitated towards movements like [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org).

## Experience

0. **London Web Standards & State of the Browser**

    *Organiser*

    *March 2018 – Present*<br><br>

    Being an avid attendee of *London Web Standards*, a bi-monthly meetup, and *State of the Browser*, an annual conference, since 2012, I was ecstatic to give my [first lightning talk](https://chrisburnell.com/talk/middle-out) in 2016. Two years later, I joined the Organisers team, and it’s been nothing short of a rewarding experience for me. At their cores, both *LWS* and *SotB* serve as free and cheap platforms for designers and developers to learn from some of the best thought-leaders and speakers in our industry.<br><br>

0. **Squiz**

    *Front-End Developer*

    *February 2018 – July 2020*<br><br>

    I was part of a small team of front-end developers tasked with supporting *Squiz’s* digital transformation projects primarily through delivering cut-ups, coordinating and building design systems with other teams, and building solutions in *Squiz’s* CMS, *Matrix*.

    - was part of an internal group in charge of building and maintaining the company’s front-end build tools
    - championed and helped to educate our developers on best practices and techniques to make our jobs easier and more enjoyable<br><br>

0. **City, University of London**

    *Web Developer*

    *June 2014 – February 2018*<br><br>

    The Web Team at *City* was in charge of maintaining *City’s* five school websites and fielding incoming requests and web-related queries. My work was heavily focussed on the CSS-side of our codebase, and this allowed me to research, build, and test a robust library of SCSS that simplified how we developed, how quickly and easily design iterations could be made, and significantly cut down on mental overhead. These skills and knowledge I acquired were critical on some important projects which I helped lead:

    - Clearing Web Application (<a href="https://clearing.city.ac.uk" target="_blank">clearing.city.ac.uk</a>) — Complex system of logic built around a Node.js app on top of a minimal design system
    - *Cass Business School* Website Refresh (<a href="https://cass.city.ac.uk" target="_blank">cass.city.ac.uk</a>) — Full implementation of a design system<br><br>

0. **Squiz**

    *Front-End Web Developer / UI Developer*

    *April 2012 – April 2014*<br><br>

    This was my first job in the industry and was extremely invigourating to learn the ins-and-outs of professional web development. My main tasks were in delivering cut-ups and building solutions in *Squiz Matrix*; although, halfway into my time I switched roles and my focus became solely on cut-ups advocating for best practices.

    - organised and ran “Implementor Scrum”, a weekly meeting for developers to have fun and build something unrelated to work and for fun, but using skills that we could hone and apply to our work<br><br>
