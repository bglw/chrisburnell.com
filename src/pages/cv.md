## Biography

I’m a self-taught developer driven by a passion for the front-end to create a faster and more open web for everyone. It’s always been important to me to keep abreast of trends on the web, and I enjoy [experimenting](https://codepen.io/{{ author.codepen }}) with these technologies to discover use-cases for my work, and I use my website as a platform to guide my learning and share what I’ve learned. In recent years, I’ve also become interested in content ownership online and have gravitated towards movements like [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org).

## Work Experience

0. **[London Web Standards](https://londonwebstandards.org) & [State of the Browser](https://stateofthebrowser.com)**

    *Organiser*

    *March 2018 – Present*<br><br>

    Being an avid attendee of *London Web Standards*, a bi-monthly meetup, and *State of the Browser*, an annual conference, since 2012, I was ecstatic to give my [first lightning talk](https://chrisburnell.com/talk/middle-out/) in 2016. Two years later, I joined the Organisers team, and it’s been nothing short of a rewarding experience for me. At their cores, both *LWS* and *SotB* serve as free and cheap platforms for designers and developers to learn from some of the best thought-leaders and speakers in our industry.<br><br>

0. **[Squiz](https://squiz.net)**

    *Lead Developer*

    *November 2021 – Present*<br><br>

0. **[Squiz](https://squiz.net)**

    *Lead Developer (Contracting)*

    *September 2021 – November 2021*<br><br>

0. **[Squiz](https://squiz.net)**

    *Front-End Developer (Contracting)*

    *February 2021 – September 2021*<br><br>

0. **[Squiz](https://squiz.net)**

    *Front-End Developer*

    *February 2018 – July 2020*<br><br>

    I was part of a small team of front-end developers tasked with supporting *Squiz’s* digital transformation projects primarily through delivering cut-ups, coordinating and building design systems with other teams, and building solutions in *Squiz’s* CMS, *Matrix*.

    - was part of an internal group in charge of building and maintaining the company’s front-end build tools
    - championed and helped to educate our developers on best practices and techniques to make our jobs easier and more enjoyable<br><br>

0. **[City, University of London](https://city.ac.uk)**

    *Web Developer*

    *June 2014 – February 2018*<br><br>

    The Web Team at *City* was in charge of maintaining *City’s* five school websites and fielding incoming requests and web-related queries. My work was heavily focussed on the CSS-side of our codebase, and this allowed me to research, build, and test a robust library of SCSS that simplified how we developed, how quickly and easily design iterations could be made, and significantly cut down on mental overhead. These skills and knowledge I acquired were critical on some important projects which I helped lead:

    - Clearing Web Application (<a href="https://clearing.city.ac.uk">clearing.city.ac.uk</a>) — Complex system of logic built around a Node.js app on top of a minimal design system
    - *Cass Business School* Website Refresh (<a href="https://cass.city.ac.uk">cass.city.ac.uk</a>) — Full implementation of a design system<br><br>

0. **[Squiz](https://squiz.net)**

    *Front-End Web Developer / UI Developer*

    *April 2012 – April 2014*<br><br>

    This was my first job in the industry and was extremely invigourating to learn the ins-and-outs of professional web development. My main tasks were in delivering cut-ups and building solutions in *Squiz Matrix*; although, halfway into my time I switched roles and my focus became solely on cut-ups and advocating for best practices.

    - worked on establishing a standard by which front-end code was written by the London team and helped educate and mentor designers and developers on collaborating on standards
    - organised and ran “Implementor Scrum”, a weekly meeting for developers to have fun and build something unrelated to work and for fun, but using skills that we could hone and apply to our work<br><br>

0. **[My Website](https://chrisburnell.com/)**

Since discovering the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) in 2017, I’ve begun posting various types of content, from simple [notes](https://chrisburnell.com/notes/) to [likes](https://chrisburnell.com/likes/) and [bookmarks](https://chrisburnell.com/bookmarks/).

    “Managing spacing between elements and components on your page can be a tiring task if undertaken manually. This is where the lobotomised owl comes in: a short, simple snippet of CSS that simplifies this whole process for you. In this article I’ll explain how I make use of it in a more dynamic way using a SCSS mixin.”<br><br>

0. **[Sparkline Sound-Off](https://chrisburnell.com/article/sparkline-sound-off/)**

    “I have been following in the footsteps of Jeremy Keith for a few months now. Dotted around my website, now, are sparklines, representing my activity over time. As an added bonus, a little tune based on the sparkline's values plays when you click on it. With a moderate amount of musical theory under my belt, here's how I accomplished that audio delight.”
