## Summary

My name is Chris. I’ve been building websites since 2008 and working professionally since 2012, during which time I’ve been able to work with a wide variety of clients, most notably in the government and higher education sectors, including [The Electoral Commission](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/), [Ministry of Justice](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice), [University of the Arts London](https://www.arts.ac.uk/), [William Hill](https://www.williamhill.com/), and more.

I specialise particularly in CSS, accessibility, design systems, progressive enhancement/graceful degradation, developer evangelism and education, technical writing and speaking, web performance, and keeping on the pulse of emerging web technologies.

## Professional Experience

### {% image './images/content/squiz-logo.svg', '', 'brand-logo' %} [Squiz](https://squiz.net) in London, UK <small style="float: right; line-height: 1.375;"> February 2018 – present</small>

#### Lead Developer & Chapter Lead <small style="float: right;"> May 2022 – present</small>

- Responsible as the primary technical contact for 8 clients, with a specialised understanding of higher-education and government websites.
- In charge of setting the standard of quality and defining the complete technical implementation for critical project work as both Lead Developer for primary clients and in a consulting role for many others.
- Managing and coaching a chapter/team of two developers, overseeing their career progression, and recognising their work by successfully referring them for pay rises and promotions.
- Formulated learning packages to grow the front end expertise of over 30 developers across the organisation, spearheading adoption of best practices and stimulating rapid growth in expertise and knowledge of web development.
- Established a robust design system for projects which *reduced development times by over 50%*, vastly exceeding client expectations, reducing mental overhead and jargon, which enabled both technical and non-technical colleagues/clients to understand and participate in dialogue about the high-level intersection between design and development.

#### Lead Developer <small style="float: right;"> September 2021 – May 2022</small>

- Defined and implemented best practices and modern web standards, and updated existing codebases in order to meet the higher standards and reduce context-switching for developers working across multiple projects.
- Acted as the Lead Developer for the northern hemisphere’s largest project of 2021, achieving massive success with the client through coordinating internal stakeholders across development, design, and UX to better align with their brand identity and make use of art direction capabilities made possible by modern CSS.
- Mentored a Junior Developer for 20 hours a week over the course of a 6-week project and was not only able to deliver the project in *half the estimated time* but also achieved *perfect Lighthouse and WCAG AA scores*.

#### Front End Developer <small style="float: right;"> February 2018 – September 2021</small>

- Contributed to both the front end and content management implementations for client work and was consistently relied-upon for expertise on the front end, particularly to do with CSS, and acted as a consultant on dozens of projects for this knowledge.
- Volunteered to join a specialised team, tasked with standardising the front end boilerplate used across the entire organisation, documented its usage, and stepped up to be the key channel for developers in the northern hemisphere to provide feedback in order to qualify the technical decisions and developer new features.
- Sole author of the first design system introduced to a project in the northern hemisphere, which has since been adopted by over half a dozen major projects, leading to more coherent codebases, which lead to a significant reduction in necessary bug fixes, support tickets, and turnaround time for ad-hoc work.
