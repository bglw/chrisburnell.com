## Experience

0. **Squiz**

    *Front-End Web Developer / UI Developer*

    *April 2012–April 2014*<br><br>

    Squiz was my first proper job in the industry, and one that I got a few months after moving to the UK in late 2011. Having not completed a degree, I put a lot of pressure on myself to absorb and learn as much as I could, and that experience was nurtured during my tenure. Suffice to say that my knowledge and gritty experience with the front-end of the web grew exponentially over those two years and built a really strong foundation on which all of my feelings and love for the web have grown.

    My role transitioned over the course of two years from *Front-End Developer* to *UI Developer* as my skills with the front-end specifically were put to good use.<br><br>

0. **City, University of London**

    *Web Developer*

    *June 2014–February 2018*<br><br>

    My responsibilities at *City, University of London* were to maintain and iterate upon the various schools’ websites and coordinate projects with the Digital Marketing Team, as well as field queries and tickets from around the University. Two projects I was involved in stand out and underscore my responsibilities at *City*:<br><br>

    **City’s Clearing Application**

    Each year, clearing is one of the busiest and most hectic periods for any University, and *City* with its five schools was no different. What was needed was a website that could handle and streamline this process for both students applying and staff handling their applications. Between another developer and myself, we found that we possessed the skills and time to be able to build something bespoke for *City’s* needs. Perhaps even more critically, our manager had great faith and confidence in our abilities to deliver the project at a high degree of quality within the timeframe required, and championed for us when laying out plans with stakeholders. What we ended up with was a robust and scaleable database managed by a Node.js application and a React front-end to communicate between the two, kept tight by a succinct but coherent design system, which was my main focus and continues to be used to this day.<br><br>

    **Cass Business School Website Refresh**

    *Cass Business School* is one of *City, University of London’s* five schools and the design of its website was outdated and sorely lacking compared to the print material being designed, so we embarked on a year-long project to rebuild and redesign the *Cass* website as much as possible. Besides grand changes to the <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr> and content of the website, an entirely new front-end codebase was developed for this project. As with the Clearing application, I was tasked with working closely with designers, building up the initial codebase, and educating the teams involved on how to feed into and apply the design system we were laying out.

    It was during this project that I was empowered and able to make leaps and bounds in my knowledge and skill with *SCSS*. During the initial planning phase of the project, I had time to work near-uninterrupted on the new codebase and implemented a number of fantastic and powerful features that gave us the agency to work extremely quickly and flexibly down the line, moulding the process of iterating the design into far more <q>agile</q> a process.

    A great majority of these features had to do with the application of the design system and an overhaul of the very way that we, as a team, were writing CSS. This was a pivotal and drastic change, but one which they were keen to learn from and be part of.

    The overarching gist of what this codebase of SCSS does is abstract away arbitrary values from the code and attach meaning and coherence instead. For example, rather than have a palette of colours where one designer calls a value “blue”, a developer calls it “#5f8aa6”, another designer thinks it’s more of a “purple”, and a second developer prefers HSL so calls it “hsl(203.7, 28.5%, 51.2%)” we opted for a “name everything” approach.

    We cast colours, measures, breakpoints, border-widths and all the rest to a common nomenclature and this vocabulary was shared amongst everyone involved in the project.<br><br>

0. **Squiz**

    *Front-End Developer*

    *February 2018–July 2020*<br><br>

    In February 2018, I made the decision to return to Squiz as a Front-End Developer. It was nice to be around old friends, see how the company and its vision had shifted in the time I was at *City*. There was much more emphasis on quality of code being shipped and the tools we were using across the organisation to ship that code.

    I was involved in a number of internal projects and <q>guilds/squads</q> aimed at improving our tooling and educating our developers on best practice and detailing our web standards. As with at *City*, I was very happy to be given the agency to implement robust CSS frameworks and their use was lauded by by developers and designers.

    Unfortunately, due to *COVID*, the London office’s problems were exacerbated, and I was furloughed in March 2020 and made redundant in July 2020.<br><br>

0. **London Web Standards & State of the Browser**

    *March 2018–present*<br><br>

    Because of my passion to make the web more accessible for everyone, I am a firm believer of conferences and meetups that allow the community to grow, enriching and pushing the boundaries of the web. I was invited by Dave Letorey to join the team of organisers for the monthly meetup, *London Web Standards*, and annual conference, *State of the Browser*. In that time, I was on the team tasked with organising a series of monthly meetups and annual conferences, *State of the Browser*.

    Soon after returning to *Squiz*, Dave Letorey invited me to join the team of organisers for the monthly meetup, *London Web Standards*, and annual conference, *State of the Browser*. In that time we’ve run dozens of monthly meetups and I was involved in both the 2018 and 2019 State of the Browser conferences, where we saw speakers from the UK and internationally come together at *Conway Hall* in Clerkenwell and deliver fantastic talks to hundreds of attendees.

    This continues to be one of my proudest achievements and very close to my heart is the ethos of our meetups: bringing together like-minded individuals who are passionate about the web to learn and grow together for the entire globe to benefit from.<br><br>
