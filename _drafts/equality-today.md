title: The Broad Brush

The broad strokes people like to paint others with in this day and age is infuriating. I’m tired of being worried to speak *at all* because I share physical attributes with people spouting vitriolic bullshit. If you start by making assumptions, you might just already be an ass.

Fundamentally, for me, it comes down to a skewed vision of equality. I don’t understand how someone can espouse equality and champion for victims of perpetual discrimination yet consistently blame a group of people, regarding them as a whole, for the inequalites they endure.

It just seems like indefensible hypocrisy to me.

I am a wholehearted advocate for equality and eliminating discrimination from this industry entirely, and I don’t mean to paint anyone’s struggles as if I understand them myself, so If I’m making any errors in my judgement of the situation, I’d love to be corrected. ❤️ you all.
