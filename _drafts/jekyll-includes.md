    <p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.</p>

I think it’s worth mentioning that a lot of these snippets of *HTML* and *Liquid* were built as a way for me to experiment with what was a new CMS (*Jekyll*) to me at the time of conception. The overarching purpose of these snippets relates to my templating and content authoring processes, whether it be to automate something, keep my codebase organised, reduce mental overhead, or to enforce a [Single Source of Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth){:rel="external"} methodology.

And because *Jekyll* is a [static site generator](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators){:rel="external"}, I don’t mind deferring the heavy-lifting to the build process and away from the user, so many of these components serve as equivalents to functionality usually relegated for *JavaScript*.

Another caveat to the challenge is that my site <s>is</s> was hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com){:rel="external"}, so only a [small set of plugins](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-jekyll-plugins-to-a-github-pages-site/){:rel="external"} are available to use. This means achieving solutions with pure *Liquid*.

Regardless of whether you agree with my approach or not, let’s take a look at how I’ve handled these functionalities and streamlined my processes using a combination of *Jekyll*-powered *Liquid* alongside some *Sass*, avoiding *JavaScript* where unnecessary.


{% include content/heading.html title='Linked Headings' %}

When authoring articles, I like to provide a way for users to share or link to a certain part of the content, which I do by including anchors to each heading in a post’s content. Users can link to these anchors and new visitors using that link will jump right to that heading in the content.

I considered *three* ways of implementing this:

0. Use *JavaScript* to parse headings in my content and inject the necessary HTML (`<a>`) after parsing
  - not using *JavaScript*
0. Maintain the heading and anchor’s *HTML* inside my *Markdown* every time I want to display a heading and its associated anchor
  - this sounds *tedious*
0. Use *Jekyll* to generate the necessary anchors whenever I use a heading
  - requires a change to the way I write *Markdown* headings, although consistent, deviating entirely from the standard *Markdown* heading syntax

I went for the third option. I did so by leveraging *Jekyll’s* *[includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#includes "Jekyll Templating Includes"){:rel="external"}* to provide the functionality and take the pain away of crafting and maintaining the markup. In fact, I make liberal use of *includes* throughout the templating of my site; anything that is used at least twice is likely to be assigned to an *include*. Maybe it’s overkill, but I like to strive for a *Single Source of Truth* methodology in my codebase *wherever possible*.

So how do I actually get *Jekyll* to build a *heading* and an *associated anchor* in my content?

As I mentioned above, it involves a slight change to the way that I write headings in my *Markdown*. Instead of writing headings in the traditional method (with preceding `#`s or <q>underlined</q> by `-`s or `=`s), I have created a *Jekyll* *include* which spits out a heading with its specifics defined in the *include’s* attributes:

{% highlight html %}
<h3 id="brass-tacks">
    Brass Tacks
    <a href="#brass-tacks" class="fragment-anchor">#brass-tacks</a>
</h3>
{% endhighlight %}

Any *Liquid* code in *Markdown* files is parsed, so let’s follow this *include* to its source and see what it does.

{% highlight liquid %}{% raw %}
<!-- 1 -->
{% assign heading_type = 'h3' %}
{% if include.type %}
    {% assign heading_type = include.type %}
{% endif %}

<!-- 2 & 3 -->
{% assign heading_id = include.title | slugify %}
{% if include.id %}
    {% assign heading_id = include.id %}
{% endif %}

<{{ heading_type }} id="{{ heading_id }}">
    {{ include.title }}
    <!-- 4 -->
    {% include content/fragment-anchor.html id=heading_id %}
</{{ heading_type }}>
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

0. The `heading` *include* accepts an optional `type` parameter, which defines the heading tag (`h1`–`h6`). If no `type` parameter is passed, the default is an `h3` tag, as this is the tag I use most often with this *include*.
0. The *include* also accepts an optional `id` parameter, which is used for both the `id` attribute on the heading tag and the target `href` attribute on the fragment anchor tag. If no `id` parameter is passed, the **required** `title` parameter is [slugified](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/){:rel="external"} to automatically generate the `id`.
0. The *include* also accepts a **required** `title` parameter, which becomes the textual contents of the heading. It may also be used to generate the `id` parameter, if it is not passed.
0. A second *include* is called from inside the `heading` *include*, to which we’re passing the `id` of the `heading` *include*.

Let’s see what the `fragment-anchor` *include* looks like.

{% highlight liquid %}{% raw %}
<!-- 1 -->
{% if include.id %}
    {% capture href %}#{{ include.id }}{% endcapture %}
{% elsif include.url %}
    {% assign href = include.url %}
{% endif %}

<!-- 2 -->
{% if include.title %}
    {% capture title %} title="{{ include.title }}"{% endcapture %}
{% endif %}

<!-- 3 -->
{% if include.rel %}
    {% capture rel %} rel="{{ include.rel }}"{% endcapture %}
{% endif %}

<!-- 4 -->
{% if include.tabindex %}
    {% capture tabindex %} tabindex="{{ include.tabindex }}"{% endcapture %}
{% endif %}

<!-- 5 -->
<a href="{{ href }}" class="fragment-anchor"{{ title }}{{ rel }}{{ tabindex }}>{{ href }}</a>
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css %}
.fragment-anchor {
    display: none;
    /* ... */
}
{% endhighlight %}

0. The *include* accepts parameters `id` and `url`, one or the other being **required** for the *include* to function. If an `id` parameter is passed then the `href` attribute of the anchor tag is set to the `id` prepended with `#`, to properly link to the correct heading on the page. If a `url` parameter is passed, then the `href` of the anchor tag is set to the `url`.
0. The *include* also accepts an optional `title` parameter, which equates to a `title` attribute on the anchor tag. If the `title` parameter is not passed, no `title` attribute is printed on the anchor tag.
0. The *include* also accepts an optional `rel` parameter, which equates to a `rel` attribute on the anchor tag. If the `rel` parameter is not passed, no `rel` attribute is printed on the anchor tag.
0. The *include* also accepts an optional `tabindex` parameter, which equates to a `tabindex` attribute on the anchor tag. If the `tabindex` parameter is not passed, no `tabindex` attribute is printed on the anchor tag.
0. For accessibility reasons and a coherent reading experience for screen readers, fragment anchors are always set to `display: none;` to exclude them from being read aloud or included in navigation searches.

{% highlight html %}
<h3 id="brass-tacks">
    Brass Tacks
    <a href="#brass-tacks" class="fragment-anchor">#brass-tacks</a>
</h3>
{% endhighlight %}

This is the fully-generated output of the original *include* in the *Markdown* file.
